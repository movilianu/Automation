"""
This file contains details of what the tests are and what they are useful for.
The tests were created using Python, Selenium and Helium.
The latter is a Python library based off of Selenium-Python. While it does the same things (mostly),
it helps keep the code cleaner and tighter and gives a better understanding of what the test is meant to do.

While against best practice, Selenium is also used in some tests for proving knowledge if nothing else.

You will notice that some tests like:
x.py
&
y.py
do almost the same thing from their title but they are written differently as to shown the different
patterns that one may use to tackle an issue.
